is estrogen-receptor positive and/or progesterone-receptor positive and lymph-node positive:There is low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX has limited prognostic value in women who are being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole,There is very low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX has limited predictive value for predicting which women will benefit from adjuvant CAF chemotherapy in women who are being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.There are methodological and statistical limitations that affect both the generalizability of the current available evidence, as well as the magnitude and statistical strength of the observed effect sizes; in particular:Of the major predictive trials, Oncotype-DX scores were only produced for a small subset of women (\u003c40% of the original randomized population) potentially disabling the effects of treatment randomization and opening the possibility of selection bias;Data is not specific to HER-2/neu-negative women;There were limitations with multivariate statistical analyses.Additional trials of observational design may provide further validation of the prognostic and predictive value of Oncotype-DX; however, it is unlikely that prospective or randomized data will become available in the near future due to ethical, time and resource considerations.There is currently insufficient evidence investigating how Oncoytpe-DX compares to other known prognostic estimators of risk, such as Adjuvant!","offsetInBeginSection":6934,"offsetInEndSection":9561,"beginSection":"sections.0","endSection":"sections.0"},{"title":"abstact","conf":0.21597969886241553,"document":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23074401","text":"Online?How

inhibits the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) by Sildenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP."},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/meltingPoint","o":"189-190 oC"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/molecularWeightAverage","o":"474.576"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/molecularWeightMono","o":"474.2049"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/msdsFiles","o":"/drugs/203/safety_sheets/851"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/patientInformationInsert","o":"http://129.128.185.122/drugbank2/drugs/DB00203/inserts/205/full"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/pharmacology","o":"Sildenafil is used to treat male erectile dysfunction (impotence) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Part of the physiological process of erection involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum. This then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), leading to smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in increased inflow of blood and an erection. Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This means that, with Sildenafil on board, normal sexual stimulation leads to increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum which leads to better erections. Without sexual stimulation and no activation of the NO/cGMP system, Sildenafil should not cause an erection."},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/pharmgkbId","o":"PA451346"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/predictedLogpHydrophobicity","o":"2.36"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/predictedLogs","o":"-3.04"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/predictedWaterSolubility","o":"4.33e-01 mg/mL"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/primaryAccessionNo","o":"DB00203"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/proteinBinding","o":"96%"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/pubchemCompoundId","o":"5212"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/pubchemSubstanceId","o":"205034"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/reference","o":""},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/rxlistLink","o":"http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/viagra.htm"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/secondaryAccessionNumber","o":"aprd00556"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/smilesStringCanonical","o":"CCCC1\u003dNN(C)C2\u003dC1NC(\u003dNC2\u003dO)C1\u003dC(OCC)C\u003dCC(\u003dC1)S(\u003dO)(\u003dO)N1CCN(C)CC1"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/smilesStringIsomeric","o":"CCCC1\u003dNN(C)C2\u003dC1NC(\u003dNC2\u003dO)C1\u003dC(OCC)C\u003dCC(\u003dC1)S(\u003dO)(\u003dO)N1CCN(C)CC1"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/state","o":"Solid"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/structure","o":"1"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/synonym","o":"Sildenafil Citrate"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/synthesisReference","o":"Nicholas K.

the Aberdeen trial utilizing different docetaxel-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.13\nApproximately one quarter of patients with breast cancer demonstrate overamplification of the human epidermal receptor type 2 (HER2) gene, resulting in an overexpression of the HER2 receptor, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, the activation of which is known to result in increased activity of a variety of molecular pathways associated with tumor growth and progression.14 Extensive published data have demonstrated that patients whose cancers overexpress HER2 have a relatively poor prognosis independent of other clinical and pathologic variables, like tumor size and nodal status.15–17\nTrastuzumab, a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody specifically directed against the HER2 receptor, has been shown to be biologically active and of considerable clinical utility in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.18 Trastuzumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1998 after a landmark Phase III trial in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer showed dramatic improvement in overall response rates and overall survival with the addition of trastuzumab to standard first-line chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel.19 Many Phase II trials have reported similar clinical benefit when this drug is combined with a number of other chemotherapeutic agents including docetaxel, vinorelbine, capecitabine, and gemcitabine, in both front-line and pretreated metastatic settings.20–25\nSo far, the results of five Phase III randomized trials exploring the benefit of adding trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy for early HER2-positive breast cancer patients have been reported.26–31 All trials demonstrated significant

and mammals, as reviewed elsewhere.14 Upon phosphorylation, YAP translocates from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where its transcriptional coactivator activity is turned off.13 The nuclear form of YAP is oncogenic because it can induce the expression of a class of genes that promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell death, such as the inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (IAP) family member, BIRC5/Survivin,13 the secreted Cysteine-rich protein connective tissue growth factor (CTGF),15 and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family member, amphiregulin.16 Overexpression of the YAP

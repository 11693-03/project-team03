Also acts as a receptor for thyrostimulin (GPA2+GPB5)"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/swissprotId","o":"http://bio2rdf.org/uniprot:P16473"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/swissprotName","o":"TSHR_HUMAN"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/swissprotPage","o":"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P16473"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/synonym","o":"Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/synonym","o":"Thyrotropin receptor precursor"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/synonym","o":"TSH-R"},{"s":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugs/DB00024","p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/target"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/theoreticalPi","o":"6.98"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/transmembraneRegions","o":"414-441"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/transmembraneRegions","o":"451-473"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/transmembraneRegions","o":"495-517"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/transmembraneRegions","o":"538-560"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/transmembraneRegions","o":"581-602"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/transmembraneRegions","o":"626-649"},{"p":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/transmembraneRegions","o":"661-682"},{"s":"http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls/id/C0034844","p":"http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls/altMetaMap"},{"p":"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type","o":"http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos-xl#Label"},{"p":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#notation","o":"C30133"},{"p":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#note","o":"NCI Thesaurus"},{"s":"http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls/id/C0034844","p":"http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos-xl#altLabel"},{"p":"http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos-xl#literalForm","o":"Thyrotropin Receptor"},{"s":"http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls/id/C0034844","p":"http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls/altMetaMap"},{"p":"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type","o":"http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos-xl#Label"},{"p":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#notation","o":"N0000168862"},{"p":"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#note","o":"National Drug File - Reference Terminology"},{"s":"http://linkedlifedata.com/resource/umls/id/C0034844","p":"http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos-xl#altLabel"},{"p":"http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos-xl#literalForm","o":"Receptors, Thyrotropin"}]}]}
